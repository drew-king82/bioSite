        Traveling is Jen’s first love. After joining the USAF Jen has traveled all over the world as an Airborne Spanish Linguist. Following her time in the military Jen continued to travel and has spent significant time in Japan, England, Greece, and Costa Rica. A lover of art and history Jen utilizes her time in each city to absorb its museums and local cuisines. There isn’t anything she won’t try once .. right? You can find her in her spare time running her local outdoor group.
